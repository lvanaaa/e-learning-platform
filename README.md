# e-learning-platform
Credits to my friend Gabriel for the back-end and database connection.
The platform features student and teacher accounts.

Student Account
Make your first student account and enjoy a bunch of courses and professors you can choose from in diverse domains of interest.
For each course you will have lessons. Each lesson has materials that you can study and homeworks to test your newly aquired skills.
At the end don't forget to leave a review, so others can reach great courses easily. Top reviews will appear on the main page.

Teacher Account
Are you a teacher and you want to be part of our community? Apply to be a teacher and our staff will review you background and knowledge.
You can create lessons inside your course, add materials to your lessons and review student's homeworks.

Subscriptions
If you enjoy the platform and you want to support further development, you can choose a subscription or you can continue to enjoy the full functionalities for free.
